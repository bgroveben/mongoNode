This is a tutorial on using MongoDB with Node.js.

I started here: https://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/node/

I am currently here: All Done, Sucka!

There is some more in-depth stuff in the manual here: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/#.

The database to use is test and the collection is restaurants.
