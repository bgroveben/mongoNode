This is a tutorial on using MongoDB with Node.js.

I started here: https://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/node/

I am currently here: https://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/node/aggregation/#group-documents-by-a-field-and-calculate-count

The database to use is test and the collection is restaurants.
